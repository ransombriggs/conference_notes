What does the join button actually do?  Managing expectations & making startup costs cheaper
	Will they be brought straight to the game or asked for credit card & login

Priority was to make things really responsive w/ javascript

Everything was going design => engineering

There was no feedback to the designer - which makes the design really hard to change at a later day

1) Everybody shares the codebase - designer to developers
	They do not do photoshop to webapp translation

2) Have real templates with logic
	HAML is out - need real logic - no waterwings
	helpers are not rendering html
	and avoiding presenters

3) Start together - designers + programmers
	working on a domain language & app structure
	programmer then designer makes Jeff sad
	designer to programmer makes reworking hard

Giant process screen - where is the customer feedback?

Why?
	ingights comes up while working together
	all views are in templates with logic
