Rails2
	ActiveRecord && ActionPack && Railtie # pretty damned coupled

Rails3
	Railtie has gotten smaller - just specializes how apps engines, etc work

Railties - hooks
	if defined? # is a smell - depends on load

module MyORM
	class Railtie < Rails::RailTie
		config.generators.orm :my_orm
		rake_tasks do
			load 'my_orm/database.rake'
		end

		config.before_configruation do |app|

		end
		# to_prepare - nice - can do something once in prod, all the time in dev
	end
end

ActiveSupport.on_load(:action_controller) do
	include MyPlugin::ControllerStuff
end

# Adding instrumentation

Upgrading
	# install rails 2.3.9 # deprecation & bridge
	# install bundler
	# install rails_xss   # look for helpers making html # form building # just using taint does not work
	                      # make sure we are using content helpers 
	# look @ deprecations log in test
	# upgrade!
	# look @ deprecations again # most obvious is config changes

			my_blog.posts_path
