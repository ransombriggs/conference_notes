Metrics based refactoring

gem install metric_fu
rake metrics:all

Now What?
	Flay	# structural duplication
	Churn	# takes source control
			# identify those that change a lot
	RCov	# make sure your coverage is good where it needs to be
			# do not solidify bugs in tests
			# write tests while you learn code
	Flog & Saikuro - complexity measurement # number of paths
			# paths vs assigns branches & calls
	Reek, Roodi, RailsBest # look for design problems

Continuous Integration
	MetricFu generates an html and yaml
	Do not fail the build on code metrics

Trends over time
	Are we actually making things better?

Coming Soonish?
	Combining multiple metrics to identify worst spots
