Culture
	Rails Maturity Models # RMM is dead 

Cargo Culting
	John Frum Cult # imitating cargo planes
	RMM just took the artifacts - easy to parrot - hard to succeed

No micro-management
No penny-pinch
No death marches
No meetings * (except daily stand up)
No hierarchy
No future proofing (keep the future out)

Process is an embedded reaction to prior stupidity

Forced heroics do not work - (let's stop pairing and writing tests!)
	Candidate goes with multiple teams
	Then they actually pair with the interviewee

How do we decide who to hire
	If it is not hell yeah - then it is a no
