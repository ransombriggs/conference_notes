First we had HTTP, and it was good, but just for documents

page-by-page model - someone asks for something, we go get it

AJAX - ask in the background and only change the relevant bits

We need it for collaboration, like chat, comments, bidding, monitoring, sports, games

Bi-directional, asynchronous, near real time, server initiated

Java Applets
    Let it go ...

Polling
    are we there yet technique
    very chatty / high traffic
    self inflict ddos

iFrame Streaming
    first embed and invisible iframe
    must use a server that supports streaming
    sends a self executing java payload
    spins the throbber which confuses users

XHR streaming
    on the client side you poll the stream
    remember what you looked at before, throw the change
    problem is that you have to dump old stuff eventually

Long polling
    the response is blocked until something is available
    problem is if your block is too long, you are wasting space
    you should use asynchronous operation in long polling server

Flash
    Go away flash!

Push frameworks
===============

Comet - no longer just long pulling, will degrade down depending on capabilities

Provides both client and server side components

Many use a pub-sub protocol called Bayeaux

Faye 

Web Sockets
    dedicated socket in the client
    fast and reliable and things like auto reconnect
    implement onopen, onmessage, onclose

Server sent events
    only sent from server to client over udp

BOSH
WebRTC
