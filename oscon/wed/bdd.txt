Requirement - someone somewhere wants something to happen

As a user, I should be able to interpolate AsciiDoc documents

The Model
    handler chain => interpolate handler => asciidoc handler => asciidoc handler chain

Unit Coverage: 100%

But can a user *actually* interpolate asciidoc documents?

Arquillian => middleware for your tests
    flexible, there are a lot of technologies that can be integrated
    extensible
        test extension SPI for test runners
        container extension for servers
        container + test extension

Basic test

public class MyTestClass {

    @Deployment
    public static Archive<?> createDeployment() {
        return ShrinkWrap.create(WebArchive.class).addXYZ();
    }

    @Inject
    private MyBean bean;

}

How does this all work?

The test is container agnostic.  In order to wire it, configure a profile in maven.

When the test is run
    start or connect to a container
    package test archive and deploy to container
    run test in container
    undeploy test archive and stop server

ShrinkWrap
    Creates the java archives

Maven resolver
    Pulls the requirements from maven

Testing a remote webpage but you want to inject behavior

@ArquillianResource - injects where it is deployed
@Drone - injects using the drone intermediary

Thucydides - adds reporting on top of arquillian
