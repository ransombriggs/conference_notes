nodejs is built around events

the event loop is always running checking for new events and firing callbacks

node has a lot of events, like when connections are opened

prefer custom events to callbacks

write your own custom events using eventemitter

require is basically an import

We declare public methods by putting them in exports

exports.foobar = function
