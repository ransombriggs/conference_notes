Password requirements are really unkind

We need to start getting out of the password business

Account chooser or email => idp web service

OAuth2 and OpenID

Access Token
    Opaque, short lived, scoped
    Must be used over HTTPS

Access token is much like a hotel room keycard

A Refresh Token
    doesn't expire until revoked
    should be kept in secure storage

OpenID connect token
    cryptographically signed by an issuer

Cross client identity (https://developers.google.com/accounts/docs/CrossClientAuth)
    web + ios + android

Greatest weakness of outh is that it assumes there is a browser

Get out of the password business

Use libraries when possible
