Code 2040
=========

Rise of the innovation economy led by software development

A massive demographic shift led by minority population

The proportion of minority tech employees does not reflect this population change

==================

Start with Freedom

Work from first principles, what you know to be true.

Stark principle - believes in honor too hard

How to choose a license (choosealicense.org)

Public domain - not a lot of legal precedence to give up my rights

WTFPL - but does not have a limitation of liability clause

Beer license - buy me a beer next time hard to enforce

MIT license - gives maximum amount of freedom without suffering from stark principle

Without giving something a license, people cannot use it, licensing empowers freedom

How to build a company

Business minimalism - only add process when it improves something
    Github is a highly networked company

Open allocation - projects compete for engineers and the result is better projects

Closed allocation - engineers compete for projects and the result is worse engineers

Start with freedom and finish with happiness

============

Components needed for vibrant community
    Great technology
    Governance
    Open source license

Two buckets - copyleft (have to give back) and permissive (do not have to)

Did not believe that a permissive license could build a vibrant community
    Most vibrant communities were copyleft communities
    Vendors engage more to communities with permissive licenses
