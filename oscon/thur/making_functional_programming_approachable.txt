The obstacles
=============

Language Minimalism

The Infrastructure and Integration Problems

Cultural Differences

Divide between corporate and academic

Entanglement in Languages that support all things

Welcoming
=========

Teaching with books

Learning at events

An abundance of online resources

Teaching recursion at a young age and threads are the devil

Start with newcomers rather than treating it as advanced

Etudes for erlang / elixir and meetups

Designing for the language to be approachable
    Scala is kind of a halfway house
    Elixir rebuilds Erlang
    ClojureScript for the web
