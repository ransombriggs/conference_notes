How do we encourage people to become better open source citizens

Motivation - internal (what I enjoy, drives) vs external (money)

Status - in open source people work towards recognition - how I feel + external validation

External motiviations have an upkeep cost

Give children toys and have them rank them.  Forbid the second favorite toy.
    I would be somewhat annoyed vs I would be angry and take away all of them
    Then leave for ten minutes and none of them actually played
    Have them rerank
        Strong threat - toy is more attractive
        Weak threat - toy is less attractive
    Cognative dissonance
        I wouldn't have enjoyed it anyway - changed thoughts to match world

Real world in Korean War
    Prisoner of war camp with essay writing competitions
    Gives out small awards for winner and people started changing their mind

Perl grants where people write for awards
    People write an essay for the grant, upon reception people really want to succeed
    How can we bring in fresh blood?
        Can we put this massive "drive safely" sign in your yard?  16.7% people agreed
        We are handing out these bumper stickers "be a safe driver"
            If they take those bumper stickers they think of themselves as safe drivers
            Compliance goes up to 76%
        Changes peoples perceptions of themselves
            Foot in the door technique, as simple as a sticker
        This is the reason entry level tasks are so important
        Reinforce their contributions like crazy
            Binds their fate to yours, they are now part of the project and care about the fate
    Text communication lacks empathy
        Biggest threat: other humans so you need to percept hostility quickly
        We will see hostility when it is only neutral intent
        Poor relationship - now everything is hostile
        Assume good intent, if possible assume at least neutral
    People like familiarity - homogeneity inertia
        People tend to self select themselves into groups like me
        Outreach and role models are important

Dopamine
    Will X make me happy?
    Will I regret this later on?
    In the short term we regret the things we do

Things that smart people regret
    Pretty balanced in terms or regret of things done vs not done
        Exceptions
            Did not pursue hobby 14%
            Wasted too much time on hobby?  0%

If you want to do something
    tweet publicly about it - you will invest yourself
    and stastically speaking you probably won't regret it
