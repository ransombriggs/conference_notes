Problem with HAML
	It is just div, div, div, div
	Seems like everything is just div and span
	If it is text use a p tag

Learn the HTML elements - not everything is a div
	Tables are alright - they are for tabular data

Semantic html is all about hierarchy and relations

Generated markup
	div_for # do not use - creates ids and classes that are not necessary
	use content_tag and semantic tagging

Avoid html markup in your helpers
	They should really just be returning a string

Zen Coding # you can write out your CSS selector and it will output the xhtml

Section 508 is about writing well formed xhtml

Rounded Corners # use CSS3 - modern browsers will see it
	the rest of the world will see boxes and be alright

Presenters: Marcel molina
	Good at encapsulation (like pagination)
	Generic Reuse
	Present It - state being passed into a page
	Helpers are methods - presenters are classes

### CSS tricks ###

Dynamic CSS # SASS
	Why generate?
		you are supporting themes
		you have an insanely large CSS set
Sprites
	reduce the number of calls for images
	image_tag => image_sprite

CSS Templates # derived from the print world
	These make things not semantic

Toupee # layered approach - turn on and off

Jammit  # compressing and make smaller for delivery
Startup # a list of generators - navagation - base layout

Code audits
	define a standard
	dust me selectors (firefox) tells you what is not used
	gem install deadweight # spider log

rack-tidy # cleans up html things

id & class
	think of ids as an instance - class as a group

which reset css should I be using
	he likes eric meyer

formtastic?

how to get people to listen to you?
	do it in terms of money (SEO)
	get UI guys who aren't afraid of development
		note - he didn't say teach developers
		make them part of the team
