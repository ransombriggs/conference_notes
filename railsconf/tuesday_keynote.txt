Rails 3.0
	Final beta or release candidate released today	

rake test EEEEEEEEEEEEEE # taking out annoyances
	bundler taking the gem headaches out of it
	a bundle is a bubble
		nothing you do not tell it to be there is there
		system gems do not exist except as a cache

ActiveRecord queries - ActiveRecord into queries
	users = User.where(:name => 'david').limit(20)
	users.where('age > 29') # chain - not executed
	users.order(:name).each {|user| puts user.name} # actually run
	Can also use this in scopes
	scopes will override to the right - # User.only_ten.limit(5)

Router
	map.resources :people, :has_one => :avatar, :member => {:foo => :post}
	
	resources :people do
		resources :avatar
		member do
			get :foo
		end
	end

	pretty - but instance_evals - eww?

	with_options is gone - scope is now the way

ActionMailer
	eww - instance variable hell
	from is a hidden default
	@foo = foo # sets partial instance variable
	default :from => 'foo@foobar.com'
	mail(:subject => 'foo', :to => 'foo@foobar.com')
	easy attachments - attachments.inline['foo.gif'] = File.read('image.gif')

Rails 3.1
	public is a big mess
	app is a beautiful place
	move into app so you can preprocess
		then compile it down # sprockets for javascripts
	sprites with CSS
		CSS is now code as well
	flush # pass head back so browser can start pulling
