Rack
	Middleware
		can be thought as filters for requests
		use MiddleWare # has access to env
		can chain these together to filter
		look at config.middleware to put filters in
		many plugins are done through middlewares
	Can match using routes
		ie: class Hello < Sinatra::Base
		match '/foo', :to => Hello

Replaced subclassing with modules
	ActiveSupport::Concern # set of tools for common module inclusion pattern
	Includes or extends Instace / Class Methods automatically

method_compilation vs method_missing

Plugin stuff
	Railties gives you access to your load process without hacks
	railtie_name => sets up your config
	define initializers && add rake tasks - do the loads
	
Engines
	Becoming first class citizens
	Total access to app.config
	Patch in middlewares & load paths etc
	Engine would clean up our app autoloading garbage

Generators
	Rails::Generators::Base
	all public methods are tasks
	you can build generators that build from others
	new and improved hooks - like testing hooks
	easier to require parameters
